# PCBreakTimer
Program to track time and away from desk, can remind you to take a break. The software works by timing how long your computer is unlocked for (at your desk "working") and how long it is locked for.
The program can be put in your startup folder to run automatically when you log in

The timer provides several counters
  -Time at desk - Total time your computer has been unlocked ("working")
  
  -Time away - Total time your computer has been locked (taking a break)
  
  -Last Break - Time since your last break
  
  -Total time - The total time the program has been running
  
  -Ratio - Percentage of time you have been at your desk
  
  
There are also several options that allow you to customise the software
  - Work day - How long you work for each day
  -Lunch Time - Set how long you take for lunch, this does not get factored into your working day

  -Default Max Time - How often the software will remind you to take breaks (resets when computer us locked/unlocked)
  
  -Add time - How much time should elapse before you are reminded to take a break again
  
  -Window positions - where the program is located when it is maximised
  
  -Popup messages - Turn on/off the option to have popups tell you when to take a break
  
  
Please report any bugs you find. Source code to be released soon(ish)
